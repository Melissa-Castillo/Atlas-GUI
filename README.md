This is my first attempt at a GUI!

It's all about my dog atlas with 11 buttons that will show you a different photo and caption. 
There are lots of comments for me so that I can remember what each part does.
I plan to organize and find ways to cut down on the length of code in my main.

Special thanks to my good boy Atlas for being so photogenic!
